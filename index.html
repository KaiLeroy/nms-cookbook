        Welcome to NMS Comprehensible Cooking Guide!<br><br>Tutorial:<br>1.Choose the desired result in the input
        box.<br>2. Press "Lock In" to display all the recipe's possible ingredients.<br>3. Sometimes, there are multiple
        choices of ingredients for the same recipe. If this happens, --multiple choice-- will be visible and you can
        clear that input box to get possible ingredients list. <br>4. Press "Lock In" again when happy with your
        decision.<br>5. Keep doing that until you have nothing else to lock in. When it happens, you'll get info about
        all the base ingredients you need.<br><br>Please remember that this is an alpha version. More features will be
        added and more bugs will be fixed. List of features I'm planning to add if my limited JS/HTML/CSS knowledge
        allows it:<br><br><strike>1. Actually displaying the amount of base ingredients you need</strike>. As of
        7/10/2020 this functionality had been added.<br>2. Having a decent user interface to look at.<br>3. Displaying
        nanite value and/or bonuses of chosen food.<br>4. Icons for all the foods/ingredients.
